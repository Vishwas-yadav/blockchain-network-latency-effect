We have tried to show the impact low latency have on percentage of blocks mined.  We have showed that low latency nodes always have advantage, this discourages people who does not have low latency to participate in blockchain, leading to low decentraloization.
Also, if the attackers have very low latency, then they can mine more than 50% blocks and can thus create malicious activities on blockchain.

No. of nodes = 10
latency distribution : 0.1s to 5 sec.
difficulty level : 2.

language used : Python. 

The above code can be run on jupyter notebook or google colab. 

Implementation is inspired from the paper " Evaluating The Impact of Network Latency on The Safety of Blockchain Transactions" by Luming Wan et.al.
